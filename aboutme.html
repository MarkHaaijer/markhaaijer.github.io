									<h1>About me</h1>
									<p>Greetings, I'm Mark.</p>
								</header>
								<p>From a young age I was in awe by videogames, starting with a particular taste in 2D and 3D platformers/sidescrollers. I was particulary interested in Super Mario games, and they inspired me to make my own Mario games using mario game sprites starting around 2010. From there I went on to make a bunch of prototypes for all kinds of games in Game Maker Studio later using only sprites I made myself. A few years later the last 2 years of high school I enrolled into IT and had courses on Javascript, html, C#, CSS and databases like SQL. Afterwards I enrolled in DAE to continue my passion for making games. Besides making games I constantly write down game ideas that I can later turn into prototypes and then incorporate into bigger games. My dream would be to have my own company Where I can basically turn my hobby of making games in my free time into a job.</p>
